                    <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                    <p>Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms. By allowing workloads to move between private and public clouds as computing needs and costs change, hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility and more data deployment options.</p>

                    <h3>DevOps</h3>
                    <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.</p>

                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.</p>

                    <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
                    <p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. In edge computing, data is processed by the device itself or by a local computer or server, rather than being transmitted to a data center.</p>
